  <h3>Macbat 64</h3>
  By SIACTRO<br/>

  3D platformer<br/><br/>
  Macbat 64 is a glorious love-letter to the late 90s which I couldn't help but fall in love with! Marcus Horn has exactly the kind of craftsmanship and care required to bring the best of my favourite childhood games to modern computers. Check out Macbat 64 and SIACTRO's other great games!<br/><br/>

  <h3>Within a Deep Forest</h3>
  By Nifflas<br/>
  Free<br/>
  2d adventure platformer<br/><br/>
  A classic indie game from the 2000s and one I've gone back to many times over the years. I even streamed it at one point! You play as a ball trying to stop Dr. Cliche from destroying the world. As you explore, overcoming difficult platforming challenges and clever puzzles you unluck new ball materials which significantly change the gameplay. It feels like there's plenty of untapped potential left in this game design so if anyone makes a game based on WaDF let me know!<br/><br/>

  <h3>Gebub's Adventure</h3>
  By John Wallie<br/>
  $5<br/>
  2d adventure platformer<br/><br/>
  Kickstarted in 2016 and released that same year, Gebub's Adventure is a wonderful throwback to the type of game I played in the early 2000s. At some point I must make a game like this myself. . . In the mean time, play John's take on this joyous genre!<br/>

  <h3>Reflection of a Fallen Feather</h3>
  By Forepaw Software<br/>
  Free<br/>
  Turn-based RPG<br/><br/>
  This one really caught me by surprise! As you go about the world having battles your characters can transform into the creatures you defeat, which brings an extra level of depth to normal things like navigating the world and deciding which enemies to fight. I was just browsing GameJolt one day when I stumbled upon it and thought it was worth a try. The mechanics were so interesting and the game so good that I went back and decided to "pay what I want" for the game after I beat it :)<br/><br/>

  <h3>Mass O' Kyzt</h3>
  By Alex Horatio<br/>
  $2<br/>
  Side-view shooter<br/><br/>
  A fun wave-based shooter with really solid gameplay. Great for letting off steam!<br/><br/>

  <h3>QWOP</h3>
  By Bennett Foddy<br/>
  Free<br/>
  Bizarre physics-based runner<br/><br/>
  Another classic I played back in my school days. This is an initially mind-bending game that seems impossible but once you get the hang of it you'll be acing the 100m sprint!<br/><br/>

  <h3>Karoshi</h3>
  By Jesse Venbrux<br/>
  Free<br/>
  2d puzzle platformer<br/><br/>
  The classic game where you win by dying! There are now 6 games in the series and they're brilliant so give them a go and see if you can figure out how to turn Mr. Karoshi into a pile of blood in each level :)<br/><br/>

  <h3>To the Moon</h3>
  By Freebird Games<br/>
  $10<br/>
  Narrative adventure<br/><br/>
  Try playing this without crying, I dare you :P When you're a bit tired of all the action and mindless fun, sometimes you want a deeply emotional story to engage with and To the Moon is one of the best examples of that in video-games.<br/><br/>

  <h3>Squirm</h3>
  By Alex Carpenter<br/>
  $2<br/>
  Challenging 2D adventure platform<br/><br/>
  Great mechanics and a well-designed world! This game only took me less than 2 hours to complete the first time, but I went back through to get all the achievements and my best 100% speedrun time is 33m 44s!<br/><br/>
