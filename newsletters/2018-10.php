<h1>Bob Ross - Sliding Paintings Museum</h1>

Today, October 29th, is Bob Ross's birthday. In his honour I have released this free puzzle game for Linux, Mac and Windows.

<h1>Notemon News</h1>

Notemon development has been trucking along nicely each week on my 1 full work day. Sometimes I think about how much faster I could get this game done if I could work on it 5 days per week, but ah well. I don't expect to be handed money for nothing so there's a lot of gamedev practice in sight for me before it's my full-time job! Anyway, at this point Notemon has more than half the battle moves, all but one of the maps, the barn system, inventory, and some other stuff. The main things not yet done are good NPCs, tools and boss fights. I feel at this point that I'm over the hump and its all smooth sailing towards Notemon's completion. Thanks a lot for being interested in the game and I hope it lives up to my vision and your hopes.

<h1>Super Secret Insider Info</h1>

This is a peek into what I've been up to that I won't yet be sharing anywhere else. After I made my "Notemon was a mistake" video I realized that I was trying to do too much in Notemon TD. As such I've decided not to make a system whereby you can select user-made maps from a menu to load from other peoples' carts. Instead I will leave it up to players to edit the original PICO-8 cartridge to create their own maps. With this change I've been working more on Notemon TD and the code is actually almost done! I've still only made the first map, and there's plenty of visual fluff to add but Notemon TD is trucking on towards completion.

I've somewhat recently come to the conclusion that I would like to return to more hand-crafted game development. Whenever I use engines like Godot and PICO-8 I find myself bashing my head against impenetrable restrictions and being disappointed by various features. So in my spare time I've been learning more C++/OpenGL so I can make games from the ground up with absolute control. My first ever released game, It All Revolves Around You, was actually written in C++. Since I'm not officially announcing these, I'm not promising I'll complete them before deciding to work on something else, but here's what I've made in this way so far. A tile mapper:

And a boating prototype based on my fish game prototype:

That's it for the first Croaking Kero Newsletter! Thanks a lot for reading and I hope you found it interesting.

Cheers.
