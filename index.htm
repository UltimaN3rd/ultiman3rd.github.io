        <h3>Steal Godot</h3>
        The Bevy of AAA Developers have shut down every free game development engine. It's up to you to break into their facility, figure out the puzzles and steal the Godot game engine back!<br/><br/>
        Steal Godot is a short, simple puzzle game featuring blocks, switches, doors and ice. It's open-source and the source code + assets are available on <a href="https://gitlab.com/UltimaN3rd/steal-godot" target="_blank">GitLab.</a> Everything in the game was made by me (Nicholas Walton) with a lot of feedback and ideas from my wife, Froggie717.<br/><br/>
